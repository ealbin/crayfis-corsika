/**
@page Particles Particle properties

The properties of all particles are saved in static and flat
arrays. There is a enum corsika::particles::Code to identify each
particles, and each individual particles has its own static class,
which can be used to retrieve its physical properties. 



See namespace corsika::particles for all classes.
